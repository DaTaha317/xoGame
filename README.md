# Tic Tac Toe Game in C# (Windows Forms)

This is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C# using Windows Forms. It is created as a project for my advanced C# class at ITI Banha.
The design is made with responsiveness in mind using proper anchoring and dockering. 

### Main Menu

The game has a side menu sticking to the left whoose buttons open up new forms in the panel to the right injecting the necessary dependencies in the form constructor. 

### MultiPlayer

You can choose to play single player against the computer or multiplayer with friends.
You can start a new game, reset the score and save the score.

### SinglePlayer

Currently, in the single player version, the computer chooses randomly and doesn't use any AI algorithms and as such it's super easy.

### Scores
